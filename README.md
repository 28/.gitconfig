# My .gitconfig

This is a repository for my customized .gitconfig. See [.gitconfig](.gitconfig)
for details.

Personal information like name and e-mail should be stored in *.gitconfig-local*
file which should be located in *home* directory where *.gitconfig* file is.

There are PowerShell and bash scripts ([install-config.ps1](install-config.ps1)
and [install-config.sh](install-config.sh) respectively) that copy *.gitconfig*
file to *home* folder and create an empty *.gitconfig-local* file.
